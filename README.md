# pleroma-ebooks

It's like [@AgathaSorceress's mstdn-ebooks] but it supports Pleroma better.

## Secure Fetch
Secure fetch (aka authorised fetches, authenticated fetches, secure mode...) is *not* supported by pleroma-ebooks, and will fail to download any posts from users on instances with secure fetch enabled. For more information, see [this wiki page](https://github.com/Lynnesbian/mstdn-ebooks/wiki/Secure-fetch).

*Note: Bots are only supported on Mastodon and Pleroma instances. Bots can learn from users on other instances, but the bot itself must run on either a Mastodon or Pleroma instance.*

pleroma-ebooks uses ActivityPub to download posts. This means that it is not dependant on any particular server software, and should work with anything that (properly) implements ActivityPub. Any software that does not support ActivityPub (e.g. diaspora*) is not supported, and won't work.

## Configuration
Configuring pleroma-ebooks is accomplished by editing `config.json`. If you want to use a different file for configuration, specify it with the `--cfg` argument. For example, if you want to use `/home/lynne/c.json` instead, you would run `python3 fetch_posts.py --cfg /home/lynne/c.json` instead of just `python3 fetch_posts.py`

A thread can be 10 or 10000 posts long, but the bot will stop after it has posted `max_thread_length` times.                                                                                                      |
